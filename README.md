# Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process that involves examining and summarizing a dataset to understand its characteristics, identify patterns, and gain insights into the data. EDA is typically performed before more advanced statistical and machine learning techniques are applied and helps in forming hypotheses, selecting appropriate modeling approaches, and ensuring data quality. Here are some key components and techniques used in EDA:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process that involves examining and summarizing a dataset to understand its characteristics, identify patterns, and gain insights into the data. EDA is typically performed before more advanced statistical and machine learning techniques are applied and helps in forming hypotheses, selecting appropriate modeling approaches, and ensuring data quality. Here are some key components and techniques used in EDA:

1. **Data Summary:** Begin by understanding the basic information about the dataset, such as the number of rows and columns, data types, missing values, and summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).

2. **Data Visualization:** Visualizing data through plots and charts can provide a clearer understanding of its distribution and patterns. Common types of visualizations include histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts.

3. **Data Distribution:** Analyze the distribution of variables to determine whether they follow normal, uniform, or other types of distributions. This can impact the choice of statistical tests and modeling techniques.

4. **Correlation Analysis:** Explore the relationships between variables using correlation matrices, scatter plots, and other correlation measures. This helps identify potential dependencies and multicollinearity.

5. **Outlier Detection:** Identify and handle outliers in the data. Outliers can significantly affect statistical measures and model performance.

6. **Categorical Variables:** Examine the distribution of categorical variables through frequency tables, bar plots, and pie charts. This helps understand the composition of categorical data.

7. **Data Transformation:** Apply transformations (e.g., log transformation, standardization) to make the data more suitable for analysis, especially if it doesn't meet assumptions of statistical methods.

8. **Feature Engineering:** Create new variables or features that might be more informative or relevant for the analysis. This could involve aggregating, combining, or extracting information from existing variables.

9. **Missing Data Handling:** Deal with missing data, either by imputing missing values or excluding incomplete records. The choice of method depends on the nature of the data and the problem at hand.

10. **Hypothesis Testing:** If relevant, perform hypothesis tests to determine whether observed differences or relationships in the data are statistically significant.

11. **Data Transformation:** Consider scaling or encoding categorical variables for modeling. This can include one-hot encoding, label encoding, or other techniques.

12. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving important information.

13. **Time Series Analysis:** For time series data, analyze trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation patterns. Techniques like autocorrelation plots and decomposition can be helpful.

14. **Geospatial Analysis:** When dealing with geographic data, use maps, geospatial plots, and spatial statistics to understand spatial patterns and relationships.

15. **Text Analysis:** If the dataset contains text data, perform text mining and sentiment analysis to extract insights from the textual content.

EDA is an iterative process, and the specific techniques and tools used can vary depending on the nature of the data and the objectives of the analysis. It plays a crucial role in gaining an initial understanding of the data, guiding subsequent analysis, and making informed decisions about the next steps in a data science or analytical project.

## Why is EDA so important in data science?

✅️ The main purpose of EDA is to help you look at the data before making any assumptions. In addition to better understanding the patterns in the data or detecting unusual events, it also helps you find interesting relationships between variables.

✅️ Data scientists can use exploratory analysis to ensure that the results they produce are valid and relevant to desired business outcomes and goals.

✅️ EDA also helps stakeholders by verifying that they are asking the right questions. 

✅️ EDA can help to answer questions about standard deviations, categorical variables, and confidence intervals.

✅️ After the exploratory analysis is completed and the predictions are determined, its features can be used for more complex data analysis or modeling, including machine learning.

## Python
👉 Python is a popular programming language for data science and has several libraries and tools that are commonly used for EDA such as:

1. [Pandas](./materials/pandas.md): a library for data manipulation and analysis.
2. [Numpy](./materials/numpy.md): a library for numerical computing in Python.
3. [Scikit-learn](./materials/scikit.md): Scikit-learn is a machine learning library, but it also includes tools for data preprocessing, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction, which are essential for EDA.
4. [Matplotlib](./materials/matplotlib.md): a plotting library for creating visualizations.
5. [Seaborn](./materials/seaborn.md): a library based on matplotlib for creating visualizations with a higher-level interface.
6. [Plotly](./materials/plotly.md): an interactive data visualization library.

In EDA, you might perform tasks such as cleaning the data, handling missing values, transforming variables, generating summary statistics, creating visualizations (e.g. histograms, scatter plots, box plots), and identifying outliers. All of these tasks can be done using the above libraries in Python.

## [Big Data EDA](./materials/big-data.md)
**Big Data** refers to the vast and complex datasets that exceed the capabilities of traditional data processing tools. It is characterized by the three **V's**: **volume** (large amounts of data), **velocity** (rapid data generation), and **variety** (different data types). **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, on the other hand, is a data analysis approach that involves summarizing, visualizing, and understanding the key characteristics of a dataset to uncover insights and patterns. In the context of **Big Data**, **EDA** plays a crucial role in making the data more manageable by identifying relevant subsets, trends, and anomalies, enabling data scientists to extract meaningful information and inform decision-making processes.
