# Assignment 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using Big Data

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a large dataset using big data tools and techniques. EDA is a critical step in understanding the characteristics of a dataset and uncovering insights that can inform further analysis and decision-making.

## Instructions

### 1. Dataset Selection
- Choose a large dataset (< 1 GB size file or <1 million data) that aligns with your interests or the project's requirements. It should be substantial in size to make use of big data tools and techniques. You can obtain datasets from various sources, such as public data repositories, Kaggle, government websites, or your project dataset.

### 2. Data Acquisition
- Obtain the selected dataset in a format that can be processed using big data tools. Common formats include CSV, Parquet, JSON, or databases compatible with big data frameworks. 

### 3. Setting Up the Environment
- Make sure you have access to a big data environment. Install the necessary tools and libraries.

### 4. Data Preprocessing
- If required, clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any data quality issues.

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Perform the following EDA tasks using big data tools:

   a. **Summary Statistics:** Compute basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quantiles for relevant numerical variables.

   b. **Data Visualization:** Create visualizations like histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to understand data distributions, correlations, and outliers.

   c. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset's structure and identify any patterns, trends, or anomalies. Pay attention to variables' distributions, relationships, and potential insights.

   d. **Feature Engineering:** If applicable, create new features or transform existing ones to better support your analysis.

### 6. Documentation
- Document your analysis, including the tools, libraries, and scripts used. Explain the key findings and insights you derived from the EDA.

### 7. Presentation
- Prepare a concise presentation of your EDA findings. Use visual aids and clear explanations to communicate your insights effectively.

### 8. Submission
- Submit your analysis report, code/scripts, and presentation to your instructor as specified in the assignment submission guidelines.

## Important Tips
- Make sure to use big data tools efficiently to handle large datasets.
- Pay attention to data privacy and ethics, especially when dealing with sensitive information.
- Collaborate with classmates or seek help from your instructor if you encounter challenges during the assignment.

## Grading Criteria
Your assignment will be assessed based on the quality of your EDA, the insights gained, documentation, and presentation.

If you have any questions or need clarification on any part of this assignment, please don't hesitate to reach out to your instructor for guidance. Good luck with your Exploratory Data Analysis using big data!

### 2. Team Collaboration
🚀 Form project teams comprising a minimum of three and a maximum of four students. Teamwork is essential for this assignment.
