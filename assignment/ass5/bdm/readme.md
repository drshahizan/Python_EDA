# Automated Feature Engineering Tools Assignment

In this assignment, you will explore the fascinating world of automated feature engineering tools in data science. Automated feature engineering is a critical step that can save time and improve the quality of features used for machine learning models.

## Task Overview
1. **Dataset Selection**: Your first task is to select a suitable dataset for this assignment. You can choose a dataset from various sources, such as Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or any other relevant dataset source. Make sure the dataset is in a format that can be easily loaded into Google Colab.

2. **Loading the Dataset**: Use Python libraries like Pandas to load the selected dataset into your Colab notebook. You can upload the dataset from your local machine or load it directly from an online source.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform a basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics. This includes checking for missing values, understanding the data types, and getting a sense of the dataset's structure.

4. **Feature Engineering with Automated Tools**: In this assignment, you will explore and use automated feature engineering tools to generate new features from the dataset. Some popular libraries for automated feature engineering include Featuretools, TPOT, and AutoML tools like H2O.ai. Choose one or more of these tools and apply them to your dataset.

5. **Feature Selection**: After generating new features with automated tools, select the most relevant ones for your analysis. You can use techniques like feature importance or domain knowledge to choose the most important features.

6. **Visualization**: Visualize the transformed and newly created features to gain insights into their distributions and relationships with the target variable.

7. **Conclusion**: Summarize your findings, the feature engineering steps you've taken with automated tools, and why you made those decisions.

## Submission
1. Create a new Markdown document in Google Colab and name it "feature_eng_tool.md"

2. Provide clear and organized explanations of each step in your Markdown document using appropriate headings and bullet points.

3. Include Python code snippets where necessary to demonstrate your implementation of automated feature engineering tools.

4. Attach your Colab notebook (`.ipynb` file) with all the code, annotations, and visualizations to your submission.

5. Make sure to include your name, student ID, and the date in the Markdown document.

6. Share the Markdown document and Colab notebook with your instructor as instructed for evaluation.

🚀 Form project teams comprising a minimum of three and a maximum of four students. Teamwork is essential for this assignment.

### 3. Academic Integrity
🚫 Uphold the highest standards of academic integrity. Any candidate suspected of cheating in the assignment will face disciplinary action, which may include suspension or expulsion from the University. Moreover, any materials or devices found to be in violation of examination rules and regulations will be confiscated.

### 4. Submission Requirements
📝 Prepare a comprehensive document that outlines the step-by-step process for creating the case study. 
The deadline for submission is **26 November 2023, at 5:00 PM**. Late submissions will not be accepted and will be disregarded.

## File and Folder Structure 

You must place your file in the submission folder. Within the [`bdm/`](https://github.com/drshahizan/Python_EDA/edit/main/assignment/ass5/bdm) folder, create a folder called your group. Name the default file as `readme.md`. Suggested folder structure for this project:

```html
bdm/your_group/
├── 📄 feature_eng_tool.md
└── 📄 readme.md
```

## Grading
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
- Dataset selection and loading
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Use of automated feature engineering tools
- Feature selection
- Clarity of explanations
- Proper documentation and comments in the code
- Correctness of the code and results

## Additional Resources
You can refer to the documentation and tutorials provided by the automated feature engineering tools you choose to use. Additionally, online resources and books on automated machine learning can be helpful for understanding these tools.

Good luck with your assignment! If you have any questions or need help, don't hesitate to reach out to your instructor or fellow students.
